6. What is the significance of Data Modelling and explain the types of data modeling.
Ans.
Significance of Data Modeling:
    Data modeling is a crucial process in the database design and development lifecycle. It involves creating 
abstract representations of the structure and relationships within a database, providing a blueprint for how data will be organized and accessed. The significance of data modeling lies in several key aspects:

Clarity and Understanding:
    Data models offer a visual representation of the data and its relationships, making it easier for
     stakeholders to understand the structure and meaning of the data.

Communication:
    Data models serve as a common language between business stakeholders, database designers, and developers, 
    facilitating effective communication about the structure and requirements of the database.

Organization and Structure:
    Data modeling helps in organizing and structuring data in a way that aligns with the business processes and goals. 
    It ensures that data is stored efficiently and can be retrieved effectively.

Identifying Requirements:
    Through the process of data modeling, the requirements of the system are identified, including entities, 
    attributes, relationships, and constraints.

Standardization:
    Data models provide a standardized way of representing data, promoting consistency and uniformity in 
    how information is stored and managed.

Scalability and Flexibility:
    Well-designed data models can accommodate changes and scale with the growth of data and evolving business 
    needs. They provide a foundation for future modifications and enhancements.

Tool for Database Design:
    Data models act as a tool for designing databases by helping database designers understand the 
    relationships between different pieces of data and defining the structure of the database.

Types of Data Modeling:

Conceptual Data Model:
    Purpose: Represents high-level entities, their relationships, and the business rules governing those relationships.
Focus: Captures the essence of the business and is independent of technical details.
Artifact: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) are commonly used for conceptual data modeling.

Logical Data Model:
    Purpose: Translates the conceptual model into a format understandable by the database management system.
     Defines tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.
Focus: Represents data without concern for how it will be physically implemented.
Artifact: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.

Physical Data Model:
    Purpose: Describes how data will be stored, including details like data types, indexing, partitioning,
     and clustering.
Focus: Specifies the physical implementation details for optimal performance.
Artifact: Database schema diagrams, data definition language (DDL) scripts.

Relational Data Model:
    Purpose: Represents data as tables with rows and columns, defining relationships between tables using keys.
Focus: Organizes data based on the principles of the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd.
Artifact: Tables, keys, and relationships in a relational database.

Object-Oriented Data Model:
    Purpose: Represents data as objects with attributes and methods, supporting concepts of encapsulation, 
    inheritance, and polymorphism.
Focus: Integrates data and behavior into cohesive units known as objects.
Artifact: Class diagrams, object diagrams.

Physical NoSQL Data Model:
    Purpose: Designed for NoSQL databases, represents data in non-tabular, flexible formats suitable for
     distributed and scalable systems.
Focus: Accommodates various data structures like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores.
Artifact: Document structures, key-value pairs, graph representations.
