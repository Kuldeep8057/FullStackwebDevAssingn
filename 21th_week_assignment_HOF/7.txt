7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.
Ans.

Three Schema Architecture:
    The Three Schema Architecture, also known as the ANSI/SPARC architecture, is a conceptual framework for organizing and understanding the design of database management systems (DBMS). It was proposed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Standards Planning and Requirements Committee (SPARC). The architecture consists of three levels or schemas, each representing a different view of the database:

External Schema (View Level):
    Description: The external schema represents the user's view of the data. It defines how each group of end-users or applications perceives the data. Each external schema is specific to a particular user or group of users.
Components: Views, application programs, user interfaces.
Focus: Describes what data a specific category of users can see and how they can access it.

Conceptual Schema (Logical Level):
    Description: The conceptual schema represents the logical structure of the entire database as seen by the database administrator. It includes the organization of data, relationships between data elements, and integrity constraints.
Components: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams, constraints.
Focus: Describes the structure of the database without detailing how data is stored or accessed.

Internal Schema (Physical Level):
    Description: The internal schema represents the physical storage structure of the database. It defines how data is stored, indexed, and accessed at the lowest level. This schema is concerned with performance optimization and storage details.
Components: Indexes, partitions, file structures, storage details.
Focus: Describes how the data is physically stored on the storage media.

Advantages of Three Schema Architecture:

Data Independence:
    Advantage: The three-schema architecture provides a clear separation between the external, conceptual, and internal levels. This separation allows for data independence, meaning changes in one level do not affect the other levels.
Benefits: Users can interact with the database without being concerned about changes in the physical storage or logical organization of the data.

Flexibility and Adaptability:
    Advantage: The architecture allows for modifications and enhancements to be made at each schema level independently. Changes in the user interface, logical structure, or physical storage can be made without impacting other levels.
Benefits: The system can evolve over time to meet changing requirements without disrupting existing applications or users.

Security and Access Control:
    Advantage: By defining external schemas, the architecture enables the implementation of security measures and access controls at the user level. Different user groups can be granted specific permissions based on their needs.
Benefits: Ensures that users only have access to the data they are authorized to view or manipulate, enhancing data security and privacy.

Improved Development and Maintenance:
    Advantage: The clear distinction between the external, conceptual, and internal levels simplifies the development and maintenance processes. Developers can focus on specific aspects without getting entangled in the complexities of other levels.
Benefits: Reduces the likelihood of errors, facilitates collaborative development, and streamlines maintenance tasks.
