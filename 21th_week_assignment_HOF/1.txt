1. What is a Database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database.
Ans.   A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. 
        It can store various types of information, such as text, numbers, images, and more, in a systematic way that allows for easy access and manipulation.

        Example:
        Consider a university system that needs to manage information about students, courses, and grades. In a database for this scenario:
        The Student table might include fields like student ID, name, address, and contact information.
        The Course table could have information about courses, including course ID, title, and the instructor.
        The Grade table would store details about student grades, with fields such as student ID, course ID, and the grade itself.
        By using a database, the university can efficiently organize and manage this information. Each student's data is stored in a structured manner, making it easy to retrieve and update. Here's why we need a database in this context:
        Data Integrity: A database ensures that data is accurate and consistent. With proper constraints and relationships, it prevents errors like entering a grade for a nonexistent student or a course.
        Efficient Retrieval: Databases allow for fast and precise retrieval of information. For example, it's easy to find all courses a particular student is enrolled in or retrieve the grades for a specific course.
        Concurrency Control: Multiple users can access the database simultaneously without interfering with each other's transactions. This is crucial in scenarios where several users need to update or retrieve information concurrently.
        Data Security: Databases provide mechanisms for securing data, ensuring that only authorized users can access, modify, or delete specific information. This is vital for protecting sensitive information like grades and personal details.
        Data Consistency: Changes made to the database are consistent and follow predefined rules. For instance, if a student's address is updated, it will be reflected consistently across all relevant records.
