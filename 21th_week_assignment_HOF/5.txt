5. List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.
Ans.    
        Database Management Systems (DBMS) can be classified based on various criteria, including data model, usage, and relationships. Here are three common types of classifications in DBMS, explained in depth:

1.Based on Data Model:

Hierarchical Model:
Structure: Represents data in a tree-like structure with a root node and hierarchical relationships.
Relationships: Parent-child relationships, where each parent can have multiple children but each child has only one parent.
Example: IMS (Information Management System) is an early example of a hierarchical database.

Network Model:
Structure: Extends the hierarchical model by allowing each record to have multiple parent and child records.
Relationships: Many-to-many relationships, creating a network of interconnected records.
Example: CODASYL database model.

Relational Model:
Structure: Represents data in tables with rows and columns, where each table corresponds to an entity.
Relationships: Relationships are established through keys, including primary and foreign keys.
Example: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server are popular relational database systems.

Object-Oriented Model:
Structure: Represents data as objects, combining data and methods that operate on the data.
Relationships: Objects can have attributes and behaviors, and relationships are modeled as associations between objects.
Example: Object-oriented databases like db4o.

2.Based on Usage:

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):
Purpose: Designed for complex queries and data analysis, supporting decision-making processes.
Characteristics: Multidimensional data representation, optimized for read-heavy operations, data aggregation.
Example: Data warehouses supporting business intelligence applications.

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):
Purpose: Optimized for transactional processing, involving frequent insert, update, and delete operations.
Characteristics: Emphasis on data integrity, concurrent access, and fast transaction processing.
Example: Transactional databases supporting day-to-day business operations.

3.Based on Relationships:

One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:
Definition: Each record in one table is associated with only one record in another table.
Example: A person's Social Security Number linking to a specific passport number.

One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:
Definition: Each record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.
Example: A customer can have multiple orders in an e-commerce database.

Many-to-Many (N:M) Relationship:
Definition: Many records in one table can be associated with many records in another table.
Example: Students enrolled in multiple courses, and courses having multiple students.
